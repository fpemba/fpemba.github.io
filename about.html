    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="bio">Bio: My name is Fatuma Pemba and I was Born in Kenya. 
      I came to the United States in 2004 knowing absolutely no English.
      This was not too much of an issue as I love learning new languages. 
      I speak a dialect of Somali called Maay-Maay and English fluently. 
      I am currently learning Korean,I love watching Korean dramas and hope to visit South Korea soon. 
      Although I am able to read in Arabic, 
      I am learning to speak and understand the language.
      My career started in the dental field while I was in  high school. 
      I was a dental assistant while I attended Ohio State University  
      for my Bachelors in dental hygiene. 
      I realized after a year I did not want to be a hygienist for a long time
       because it did not let me be creative. I wanted to be able to create different 
       things using the technology that I loved.My little brother was taking 
       computer science courses and I was so interested in what he was learning. 
       Now, in a different form, I would like to learn the language of computers.  
       Attending WeCanCodeIT, I feel that I am finally able to accomplish 
       this career goal and hobby of mine.
