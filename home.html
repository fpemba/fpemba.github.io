            <p> My name is Fatuma Pemba and I was Born in Kenya.
              I came to the United States in 2004 knowing absolutely no English.
              This was not too much of an issue as I love learning new languages.
              I speak a dialect of Somali called Maay-Maay and English fluently.
              I am currently learning Korean,I love watching Korean dramas and hope to visit South Korea soon.
              Although I am able to read in Arabic,
              I am learning to speak and understand the language.
              My career started in the dental field while I was in high school.
              I was a dental assistant while I attended Ohio State University
              for my Bachelors in dental hygiene.
              I realized after a year I did not want to be a hygienist for a long time
              because it did not let me be creative. I wanted to be able to create different
              things using the technology that I loved.My little brother was taking
              computer science courses and I was so interested in what he was learning.
              Now, in a different form, I would like to learn the language of computers.
              Attending WeCanCodeIT, I feel that I am finally able to accomplish
              this career goal and hobby of mine.
