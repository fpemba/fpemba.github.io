        <div class="main_bio">
          <p> My name is Fatuma Pemba and I was Born in Kenya.
            I came to the United States in 2004 knowing absolutely no English.
            This was not too much of an issue as I love learning new languages.
            I speak a dialect of Somali called Maay-Maay and English fluently.
            I am currently learning Korean,I love watching Korean dramas and hope to visit South Korea soon.
            Although I am able to read in Arabic,
            I am learning to speak and understand the language.
            My career started in the dental field while I was in high school.
            I was a dental assistant while I attended Ohio State University
            for my Bachelors in dental hygiene.
            I realized after a year I did not want to be a hygienist for a long time
            because it did not let me be creative. I wanted to be able to create different
            things using the technology that I loved.My little brother was taking
            computer science courses and I was so interested in what he was learning.
            Now, in a different form, I would like to learn the language of computers.
            Attending WeCanCodeIT, I feel that I am finally able to accomplish
            this career goal and hobby of mine.
