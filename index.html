                    <p> My name is Fatuma Pemba and I was Born in Kenya.
                        I came to the United States in 2004 knowing absolutely no English.
                        This was not too much of an issue as I love learning new languages.
                        I speak a dialect of Somali called Maay-Maay and English fluently.
                        I am currently learning Korean,I love watching Korean dramas and hope to visit South Korea soon.
                        Although I am able to read in Arabic,
                        I am learning to speak and understand the language.
                        My career started in the dental field while I was in high school.
                        I was a dental assistant while I attended Ohio State University
                        for my Bachelors in dental hygiene.
                        I realized after a year I did not want to be a hygienist for a long time
                        because it did not let me be creative. I wanted to be able to create different
                        things using the technology that I loved.My little brother was taking
                        computer science courses and I was so interested in what he was learning.
                        Now, in a different form, I would like to learn the language of computers.
                        Attending WeCanCodeIT, I feel that I am finally able to accomplish
                        this career goal and hobby of mine.</p>

                    <p>This is a console based game in which a shelter rescues pets. The pet can be organic
                        or robotic, dog or cat. Depending on the features, the pets behave differently.
                        Some of the features the user can choose in order to interact with the pets
                        within the shelter are rescue, feed, play, walk, and clean.

                        Hospital</a>
                    <p>This console based project involves a hospital which hires four specific employees: a doctor,
                        nurse, receptionist, and janitor. All employees share certain features
                        such as employee ID, receiving salary, and having a name. However, each employee also has a
                        specific task.
                        The user is able to play as any employee.
